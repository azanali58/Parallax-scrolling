# Parallax scrolling

## Overview

This project is a part of my Internship at Limelight, and it demonstrates a parallax effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The parallax effect is achieved by creating fixed background elements that move at different speeds as the user scrolls, creating a visually engaging experience.

## Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the content and includes the necessary scripts and stylesheets.

- **styles.css**: The CSS file containing styles for the parallax effect, container, and content.

- **script.js**: The JavaScript file handling the parallax effect based on the user's scroll
